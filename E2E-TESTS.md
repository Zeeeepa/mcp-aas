# End-to-End Testing for MCP-aaS

**Note: The E2E tests have been removed from this repository as they were not passing and required significant updates to work.**

If you need to implement E2E tests for this project, consider using one of the following approaches:

1. **Playwright**: A modern end-to-end testing framework that supports multiple browsers
2. **Cypress**: A JavaScript end-to-end testing framework
3. **Selenium**: A widely-used browser automation tool

## Recommended Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and functions
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user flows

## Setting Up New E2E Tests

If you decide to implement new E2E tests, consider the following steps:

1. Choose a testing framework (Playwright, Cypress, etc.)
2. Set up the testing environment
3. Write tests for critical user flows
4. Integrate tests with CI/CD pipeline

## Best Practices

1. Focus on critical user flows
2. Keep tests independent and isolated
3. Use stable selectors
4. Implement proper error handling
5. Run tests in a CI/CD pipeline
